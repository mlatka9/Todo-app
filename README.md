### What I learned

This project helped me practice a lot of things. I need to create a layout using CSS custom properties. I used these properties to implement a dark and light theme. I needed to manipulate DOM to dynamically change content. I added simple animation with every insert and remove todo.¬† I also implement store user's todo, their order, and theme preference in localStorage. With this feature, when the user will visit the website again, nothing will disappear.
